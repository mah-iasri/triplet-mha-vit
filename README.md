## Overview

This repository provides the complete codes of our [work](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2025.127743) 
published in Expert systems with applications. In this study, we proposed an inproved ViT network 
which introduces triplet multi-head attention (t-MHA) function within the transformer encoder. 
The t-MHA function includes cascading arrangement of attention units with residual connections, 
enabling the proposed network to progressively refine attention scores across multiple dimensions, 
learning more fine-grain feature representation of the images. Here, we have considered the two 
most important crops, viz., Rice and Apple (aka RicApp dataset), which contribute a lot to the 
overall GDP of this country. The proposed ViT network obtained a classification 
accuracy of 97.99% on unseen test data of the RicApp dataset, outperforming the standard Vision 
Transformer (ViT) by 2.2%. Therefore, the proposed network offers a precise and efficient solution for automated crop 
disease detection, with promising applications in real-time crop monitoring and precision agriculture.

## Novel Contribution

The core architectural innovation is the replacement of the standard MHA encoder sublayer with a **Triplet Multi-Head Attention (t-MHA)** block:

### Standard ViT Encoder Block
```
Input ──► LayerNorm → MHA → Add (residual) → LayerNorm → MLP → Add (residual) ──► Output
```

### Triplet-MHA ViT Encoder Block (Ours)
```
Input ──►  tripet-MHA ──► Output

'triplet-MHA function'

    ──► LayerNorm → MHA-1 → Add (residual) ──────────────────────► x2
          └─► LayerNorm → MHA-2 → Add (residual) ─────────────────► x4
                └─► LayerNorm → MHA-3 → Add (residual) ────────────► x6
                      └─► LayerNorm → MLP (GELU) → Add (residual) ─────► 
```

Each MHA sublayer attends over the full patch sequence, with residual connections preserving gradient flow across all three stages. This allows:

1. **MHA-1** — global patch relationship learning
2. **MHA-2** — refinement of coarse attention maps
3. **MHA-3** — fine-grained disease feature localisation
4. **MLP** — non-linear feature transformation and projection

## Dataset

In this study, we collected a large number of disease-infected images of Rice & Apple crops 
(aka RicApp dataset) from diverse agro-climatic regions of India. These images were collected 
in the natural field conditions under the supervision of domain experts from agricultural 
universities (Sher-e-Kashmir University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, Srinagar; 
Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya, Nadia, and University of Agricultural Sciences, GKVK, Bangalore).
The dataset consists of approximately 7,331 raw images categorized into 10 classes of Apple crop and
around 12,322 images categorized into 11 classes of Rice crop.

## Dataset Preparation

The model expects a dataset organised into class sub-folders under each split directory:

```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── Apple___Apple_scab/
│   │   ├── image_001.jpg
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── Apple___Black_rot/
│   ├── Apple___Cedar_apple_rust/
│   ├── Rice___Blast/
│   ├── Rice___Brown_spot/
│   └── ...   (21 classes total)
├── val/
│   ├── Apple___Apple_scab/
│   └── ...   (21 classes total)
└── test/
    ├── Apple___Apple_scab/
    └── ...   (21 classes total)
```

**Supported image formats:** `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`

All images are automatically:
- Resized to `224 × 224` pixels
- Converted to RGB (3 channels)
- Normalised to `[0, 1]` float32

Class labels are assigned as integers in **alphabetical order** of sub-folder names.

---

## Configuration

All hyperparameters and paths are controlled from a single file: `configs/config.yaml`.

> **Before training, update `paths.dataset_root`** to your actual dataset location.

```yaml
paths:
  dataset_root: "/your/path/to/dataset"
  train_dir:    "train"
  val_dir:      "val"
  test_dir:     "test"
  results_dir:  "results"

data:
  img_size:   224
  n_classes:  21

model:
  patch_size:              [12, 12]
  embed_dim:               64
  num_heads:               8
  dense_units_multipliers: [4, 1]   # → [256, 64]
  mlp_head_units:          [128]
  dropout:                 0.3

training:
  batch_size:    128
  epochs:        100
  learning_rate: 0.001
  weight_decay:  0.0001

callbacks:
  monitor:        "val_accuracy"
  mode:           "max"
  save_best_only: true
  tensorboard:    true
```

---

## Training

```bash
python scripts/train.py --config configs/config.yaml
```

On each run, a new experiment directory is auto-created (`results/exp0/`, `results/exp1/`, ...) so that no previous experiment is ever overwritten.

**What happens during training:**
1. Dataset loads from `train/`, `val/`, and `test/` directories
2. Model is built and compiled with `Adam` optimizer  and `categorical cross-entropy` loss function
3. `ModelCheckpoint` saves the best model weights to `weights/best_model.hdf5` on the basis of best `val_accuracy`
4. `CSVLogger` streams per-epoch metrics to `train_logs/train_logs.csv` during the training time
5. `TensorBoard` logs are written to `tb_logs/` (disable in config if not needed)
6. After training, the final model is saved as `weights/last_model.hdf5`
7. Training curves (accuracy, loss, precision, recall) are saved as PNG format

**Monitor training with TensorBoard:**
```bash
tensorboard --logdir results/exp0/tb_logs
```

---

## Evaluation

Load any saved `.hdf5` checkpoint and evaluate on the test sets:

```bash
python scripts/evaluate.py \
    --config  configs/config.yaml \
    --weights results/exp0/weights/best_model.hdf5
```

**Output:**
- Prints accuracy, loss, precision, and recall to the console
- Generates a per-class **classification report** (sklearn format)
- Saves `results_best.xlsx` with:
  - Sheet 1 — Full confusion matrix
  - Sheet 2 — Per-class classification report
---

## Results & Outputs

After a completed training run, the experiment folder contains:

```
results/exp0/
├── weights/
│   ├── best_model.hdf5        ← Best val_accuracy checkpoint
│   └── last_model.hdf5        ← Final epoch weights
├── train_logs/
│   ├── train_logs.csv         ← Epoch-wise metrics (loss, acc, precision, recall)
│   ├── accuracy_curve.png
│   ├── loss_curve.png
│   ├── precision_curve.png
│   ├── recall_curve.png
│   └── results_best.xlsx      ← Confusion matrix + classification report
└── tb_logs/                   ← TensorBoard event files
```
